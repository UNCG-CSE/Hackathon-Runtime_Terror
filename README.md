## General Info

For the 2020 UNCG Green Fund Hackathon, teams were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard reflecting the energy consumption for the UNCG campus. All actual data comes from 81 meters placed across the campus which started tracking data in 2015. The predicted data was previously found by using linear models. This dashboard will be used to aid the UNCG Facilities Operations in making decisions. 

## Functionality

Our dashboard displays an interactive map of all the buildings on the UNCG campus. When hovered, the buildings display the actual and predicted values for their energy consumption. Scrolling down the page, we have an interactive graph that shows energy consumption for one or more buildings varying based on the selected variables. The last graph displays the mean values of both Actual data and Predicted data. The data displayed in this graph represents energy usage for UNCG from 2020-01-01 to present.

## How to Run

To display the dashboard:
1. Download or Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run this app with `python app.py`
4. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser

## About the Team

**Christopher Brantley**  
*"Christopher is a senior in the Computer Science program with a concentration in Data Science and is minoring in mathematics. He has been studying programming for five years. He enjoys persuing good software design, playing with web design, and learning the features of languages. He plans to graduate in the spring of 2021 and join the graduate program in Fall 2021. In his free time Christopher enjoys hiking, playing the guitar, and reading."*    

**Andy Kawabata**  
*"Since I began coding a few years ago, I have been dedicated to increasing my understanding in all aspects of computer science and building useful applications. I love being able to use data to help further our understanding of the world we live in. I'm currently a senior UNCG and work as a tutor in the computer science department."*

**Kyle Supple**  
*"Hi, I am a computer science major at UNCG. I really enjoy anything to do with programming including creating web apps, machine learning models, bots, and writing scripts that make my life easier. Programming appeals to me because it allows me to break a complex problem down into its fundamental parts. In my free time I'm usually working on my latest project or I'm up in the mountains biking and climbing with friends."*

**Katelynn Urgitus**

  *"I am a senior Computer Science major with a concentration in Data Science. I fell in love with data after I took a class in Machine Learning. I have always loved math and statistics, so I figured computer science would be a good field for me. Aside from school, I enjoy playing with my dog, Joel, and improving my art skills."*
